# Movie seat booking

### Baseline project taken from Brad Traversy Udemy course

Expanded functionalities including:
- memorisation of movie seats booking for different movies through local storage
  - in this way it is possible to select seats, change the movie, going back to the previous movie and find the selection made earlier
- introduction of Premium Seats at a different price tag

The new version also include a re-design of the interface.
